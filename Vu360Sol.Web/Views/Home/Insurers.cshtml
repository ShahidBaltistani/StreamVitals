                        StreamVitals, with its remote monitoring suite of products & services can help practices/providers in your networks increase their HEDIS scores by filling care gaps and improving compliance and overall health. This in turn will help Health Plans attract more subscribers and ultimately may lead to larger bonus payments to the insurers from Medicare.

                        Health Plans that have practices/providers with strong HEDIS scores, will be noted and attract more subscribers to their respective plans and their overall STAR ratings from The CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) will increase. A rating of 4 STARS and above may allow the plan to get additional Medicare bonuses above and beyond their standard reimbursement.

                        If a Health Plan is rated 4 STARS and above, this could potentially generate an additional bonus of $500/subscriber
